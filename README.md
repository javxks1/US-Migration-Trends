## Overview

The US Migration Trends Report (2010–2020) is a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes both **internal migration** (state-to-state) and foreign immigration across the United States over the span of a decade.

This project provides visual insights into how populations shifted between states and across international borders, making it ideal for demographers, policymakers, analysts, and researchers studying U.S. migration patterns.

- **Origin Breakdown**  
  Identify the top contributing states and foreign countries for each state's inbound and outbound migration.

- **Migration Volume Comparison**  
  Compare annual migration volume from domestic vs. foreign origins using clean line graphs.

- **Migration Rate Calculations**  
  Visualize how migration impacts population change with calculated migration rates per state per year.

- **Foreign Migration Insights**  
  See which states attracted the most international migrants and how those patterns evolved over the decade.

- **Raw Data Section**  
  Access and export underlying datasets for further analysis, modeling, or academic research.
